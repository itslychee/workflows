= Nix Workflows

Simple idiomatic flake templates so I don't have to write them 20 times anyways!

== Goals!
* Keep dependency footprint small
* Avoid using dependencies for the flake itself, they're templates!
* Avoid using abstractions for `flake.nix`, they should be added to projects themselves, not my
templates repository
